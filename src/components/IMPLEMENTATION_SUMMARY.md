# Content Card System Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully created a generalized, normalized card component system that replaces the previous section-specific implementations. This new system provides flexibility in creating various card layouts while maintaining consistency across the application.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Components

#### ContentCard Component (`src/components/ui/ContentCard.tsx`)

- Unified card component with three style presets:
  - `standard`: Full-height cards (640px/672px)
  - `compact`: Medium-height cards (400px/500px)
  - `location`: Location-style cards with unique gradients
- Normalized props: `heading`, `title`, `backgroundImage`, `link`, `cardStyle`

#### CardLayout Component (`src/components/layout/CardLayout.tsx`)

- Flexible layout system supporting:
  - Single column
  - Two-column grid
  - Three-column grid
  - Four-column grid
  - Mixed layouts (1+2, 2+3)
- Configurable spacing: `tight`, `normal`, `relaxed`
- Container width options: `full`, `container`, `narrow`

#### ContentCardsSection Component (`src/components/sections/ContentCardsSection.tsx`)

- Complete section component that combines cards with layouts
- Accepts an array of cards and layout configuration
- Optional section title support

### 2. Backend Schemas (Sanity)

#### contentCard Object Schema (`src/sanity/schemas/objects/contentCard.ts`)

- Normalized card data structure
- Fields: `heading`, `title`, `backgroundImage`, `link`, `cardStyle`

#### contentCardsSection Schema (`src/sanity/schemas/sections/contentCardsSection.ts`)

- Section schema for flexible card layouts
- Configurable layout, spacing, and container width

### 3. TypeScript Types

- Updated `src/sanity/types/index.ts` with new types
- Added `ContentCard` and `ContentCardsSection` types
- Removed old section-specific types

## What Was Removed

### Backend Schemas

- `tocaTuesdaySection.ts`
- `ourStorySection.ts`
- `onTheMenuSection.ts`
- `locationSection.ts`

### TypeScript Types

- `TocaTuesdaySection`
- `OurStorySection`
- `OnTheMenuSection`
- `LocationSection`

## Migration Path

### Frontend Components

The old section components have been completely removed:

- `TocaTuesdaySection` → Removed (use ContentCardsSection with `layout='single'`)
- `OurStorySection` → Removed (use ContentCardsSection with `layout='single'` or `'two-column'`)
- `OnTheMenuSection` → Removed (use ContentCardsSection with `layout='single'` or `'two-column'`)
- `LocationSection` → Removed (use ContentCardsSection with `layout='three-column'` and `cardStyle='location'`)

All card-based sections must now use ContentCardsSection.

### Content Migration in Sanity

1. Create new `contentCardsSection` entries
2. Copy content from old section types
3. Configure layout (single, two-column, three-column, etc.)
4. Update page references
5. Delete old section entries

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Normalized Data Model**: Consistent structure across frontend and backend
2. **Layout Flexibility**: Supports all layout patterns from the design
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with normalized types
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: One component system instead of four separate implementations
5. **Easy Content Management**: Editors can create any card layout through Sanity
6. **Future-proof**: Easy to add new card styles or layouts

## Documentation Created

1. **CARD_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Technical documentation of the component system
2. **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Step-by-step guide for migrating from old sections
3. **ContentCardDemo.tsx**: Demo component showing all layout possibilities

## Next Steps

1. Update existing pages in Sanity to use `contentCardsSection`
2. Remove references to old section components in production code
3. Train content editors on the new flexible system
4. Consider adding more card style presets as needed
